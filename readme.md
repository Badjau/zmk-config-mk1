# TBK-"Micro" MK1
**TBK-"Micro" Mk1** is a modified version of the [TBK-Mini](https://github.com/Bastardkb/TBK-Mini/).  
The original design featured slits and gaps that gave the keyboard an "open" aesthetic which I redesigned to create a more compact and enclosed form factor while adding support for an integrated OLED screen.

### OLED views 
* Right split OLED display shows Battery level, bluetooth profile 1 to 5, WPM and WPM graph, and layer profile. Left split shows a nice little _typing_ animation of the logo, along with the name.

### Thoughts and Challenges
This was my first ever custom keyboard. I learned blender in order to manipulate and modify the base 3D model where I learned that vertices, and topology management, is hard... I even had a back and forth on using CAD and Blender to see which one is easier, as I also tried modifying the CAD file, which I did first. I then finalized and fine tuned using blender. Soldering the diodes was an easy task. Wires however, is a challenge on its own; some broke off after soldering, even breaking the pads they were soldered on after the fact. I fixed this by using a lot of flux and adjusting the heat. The microcontroller's attachment is also not the best; I had to remove, soldering off some parts inside, and the USB port in order to make it fit.
